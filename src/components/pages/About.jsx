      <p>
        My name is Josue Feliciano, I was born in Nyack, New York, and moved to
        Florida when I was about 4yrs old. I was very interested in technology
        at a young age opening anything I could get my hands on and see how it
        works. That curiousity transfered very nicely when I found out about
        computers. In Highschool I joined the STEM program and studied Robotics,
        Game Design and Simulation. Once I graduated I went into a Vocational
        course for machining. And thats what I've been doing for the past 4
        years. Wanting to something different I am currently enrolled in
        UCF-Coding Bootcamp so i can become a web developer.
